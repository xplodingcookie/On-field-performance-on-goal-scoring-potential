# Introduction of intended use for code and csv data files

This program is designed to analyse and model the correlation between on-field actions of
AFL and their goal-scoring potential. It process a provided dataset of AFL player statistics
and generates correlation graphs (metric vs goals) and a regression tree. It also creates
KNN, linear regression and regression tree models and evaluates them.

# File structure and use of each file
- correlation_graphs folder is used to store all correlation plots
- AFL-2022-totals.csv is a csv data file containing the data used to answer the research question
- Description.txt is a short explanation of the data used
- project_code.py is the python code

# project_code.py is the main file, running it will provide the graphs and results

# Instructions on how to run your code.
1) Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2) Download the program files onto your system.
3) Open a terminal and execute: python project_code.py
4) The program will process the dataset and generate scatterplot and regression
   tree plots as well as print the evaluation metrics in the terminal.
5) The generated scatterplots will eb saved in a folder named "correlated_graphs"
   in the root directory.
6) The regression tree plot will be saved in the root folder.

# Any additional requirements needed to run code.
The following libraries are needed in order to run the code:
    pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, sklearn
